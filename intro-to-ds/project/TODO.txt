### Question(s) for Analysis

Once we have our data organized and usable, I'll work through the following questions:

1. Does median household income have a positive, negative, or no correlation with NICS background checks?

2.  What does that look like when the NICS data is broken out to the different firearm types (`handgun`, `other`, `long gun`). Is the disparity between the three types generally the same across all of the states? I would assume a state like Rhode Island has a significantly smaller `long gun` background check percentage that somewhere like Wyoming, where recreational hunting is much more prominent.
    - Do any other factors potentially have an influence?
      - Lower population per square mile
      - Larger land area
      - Number of veterans
